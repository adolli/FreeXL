if you using VC6, you must add GDI+ SDK, you can download GDI+ library from my homepage

 -- http://www.crazy-bit.com/download/gdiplus.zip

unzip this package to ImageStone's lib directory in such folder structure:

lib\gdiplus\Include\*.h
lib\gdiplus\Lib\GdiPlus.lib

add .h and .lib path to your VC6's directories
